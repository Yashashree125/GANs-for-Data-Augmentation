A Comprehensive Approach for Waste Management with GAN-Augmented Object Detection and Classification using Computer Vision.

One of the most promising and widely used applications of data augmentation is in classifying waste object images. This repository focuses on augmenting
waste object images with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS). Here, Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), an extension of GAN, is utilized, which uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers for better image generation. This approach help generate realism and variability in images. Furthermore, object detection
and classification techniques are used. By utilizing ensemble learning techniques with DenseNet121, Convnext, and Resnet101, the network can accurately identify and classify
waste objects in images, thereby contributing to improved waste management practices and environmental sustainability.
